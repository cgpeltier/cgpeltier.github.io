### College Football Analysis
I learned data science in large part through analysis of college football data. Between the 2013 and 2019 college football seasons I wrote twice-weekly articles for [Football Outsiders]("https://www.footballoutsiders.com/") and various [SB Nation]("https://www.sbnation.com/") sites using advanced football analytics. Below are some of my college football projects:
